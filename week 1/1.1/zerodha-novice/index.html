        Attention investors: 1) Stock brokers can accept securities as margins
        from clients only by way of pledge in the depository system w.e.f
        September 01, 2020. 2) Update your e-mail and phone number with your
        stock broker / depository participant and receive OTP directly from
        depository on your e-mail and/or mobile number to create pledge. 3)
        Check your securities / MF / bonds in the consolidated account statement
        issued by NSDL/CDSL every month.

        "Prevent unauthorised transactions in your account. Update your mobile
        numbers/email IDs with your stock brokers. Receive information of your
        transactions directly from Exchange on your mobile/email at the end of
        the day. Issued in the interest of investors. KYC is one time exercise
        while dealing in securities markets - once KYC is done through a SEBI
        registered intermediary (broker, DP, Mutual Fund etc.), you need not
        undergo the same process again when you approach another intermediary."
        Dear Investor, if you are subscribing to an IPO, there is no need to
        issue a cheque. Please write the Bank account number and sign the IPO
        application form to authorize your bank to make payment in case of
        allotment. In case of non allotment the funds will remain in your bank
        account. As a business we don't give stock tips, and have not authorized
        anyone to trade on behalf of others. If you find anyone claiming to be
        part of Zerodha and offering such services, please
        <a href="">create a ticket here.</a>
