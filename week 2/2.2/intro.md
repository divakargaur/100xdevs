## ECMAScript 
- scripting language specification on which JavaScript is based (JS contains additional features like DOM) 
- ECMAScript is sort of a set of guidelines that browsers/compilers need to follow
- e.g. V8 in chromium, SpiderMonkey in firefox

ECMAScript -> the specification

JavaScript -> the implementation


## Node.js

- V8 + some backend stuff like http

## Bun
- competitor to Node.js (outperforming already)
- written in zig


## HTTP
- hyper text transfer protocol
- protocol for the communication of frontend & backend
